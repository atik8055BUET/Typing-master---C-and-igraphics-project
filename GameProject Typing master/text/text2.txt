Artificial Intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing healthcare,
enhancing diagnostics, treatment planning, and
patient care. Machine learning algorithms analyze
vast datasets to identify patterns and predict disease
risks, enabling early intervention. AI-driven
technologies streamline administrative tasks, reducing
healthcare costs and improving efficiency. As we
navigate this transformative era, ethical considerations
and data security become paramount, necessitating
robust regulations and responsible AI development.
